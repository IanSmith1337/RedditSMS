# About

RedditSMS is a website that utilizes Pusher's Realtime Reddit API to monitor a subreddit for new posts. This monitoring grabs the post url and title and posts it to the homepage as a button.

# What's next

I'm currenty learning Ruby so I can take input from the SMS tab and put it in an SQL database and then send texts to whoever signed up.
